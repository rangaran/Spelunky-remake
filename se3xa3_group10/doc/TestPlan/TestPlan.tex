\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of the document is to describes the testing plan, procedures, and tools the development team will use to validate and verify the system functions and behaviour. All of the test cases describe in the document have been set before the final implementation is completed or applying testing in the development process. This document will be used in the next phases of the project to verify that the development team is on the right track and that the system meets the requirements.

\subsection{Scope}

The scope of the test plan is to guide the development team in the testing phase of the project by providing an outline of the required test cases and type of testing the development team needs to adapt to verify the system functionality.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

The test plan document will give a complete description of the project's testing techniques, tools, and schedule of execution. Also, the document will outline specific tests cases with description of how to execute the testing and goal of each. The test cases will be primarily used to provide verification of the system following the requirements. 

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}

MacLunky is a re-implementation of the open source Pylunky game that is a Python version of the original Spelunky game. The objective of the game is to reach the end point of the game by advancing through the game map without losing all life points. The game will feature enemy characters and traps that will present as challenges throughout the game. However, the player will have access to weapons and tools that if used properly will provide a defense mechanism for the player and means to ensure the player survives the game course. The player will start with heartStartAmount life points and weapons that can be used at any point in the game. If the player wins the game it will end with inputting username that is saved with the game; else the game will shut down and close the window.

\subsection{Test Team}

The test team for this project will be the development team of MacLunky. Each team member will be responsible for writing and executing tests suites for the modules. The work breakdown of the testing suites will be assigned in the next project milestone.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

The project will not be using automated testing approach in the testing phase of the project. The testing team decided to use manual testing approach. The reason behind this decision is because the project involves the redevelopment of game the main focus of testing will be to provide a fully functional and enjoyable gaming experience. The testing will showcase the importance of validating user interactions with the system and presenting an easy to use implementation of the original game that is more challenging. Another reason for not using automated testing is that the development team don't have access to the appropriate tools required to executes tests in this approach therefore using manual testing approach increase the testing team confidence in executing test correctly and efficiently. 

\subsection{Testing Tools}

The testing plan will not specify any testing tools that will directly used for the system testing of the project since the team has adapted a manual testing approach. The only tools the tests will be using are command-line executions and executable windows to generate the game and run the tests on. However, \st{the project will use coverage metric tool called Coverage.py that will measure the code coverage of the program and provide a coverage report} \textcolor{red}{the team decided not to dive into automated testing tools for coverage metrics due to the time constraints on the project}. 

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
		
See Gantt Chart under the Gitlab repository of the project under the Project Schedule folder.\\
The following table will outline the testing results of the FR testing and NFR testing done for the POC and Rev0 demonstrations.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

All the test cases in this document have a direct relation to the system requirement stated in the SRS document. Each test case is designed to prove at least one requirement. The traceability between the test cases and the requirements have been explicitly mentioned in the above test cases. 

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

\subsection{Display}
The PoC tests covered the basic camera and user interface. The camera is fixated on the player and moves within the boundaries of the map to keep the player in focus. The player's health and gold is displayed and updated when taking damage and collecting treasure. (3.1.2)

\subsection{Player}
The PoC tests covered the movement, states, and actions of the player. The player can move in four directions and has idle, walking, falling, climbing, and crouching states. Each has their own specific movement restrictions. Idle has no movement. Walking has left and right. Falling has all 4 directions while in the air. Climbing has up and down only on ropes. And crouching is for holding down while idle. The player can jump, open chests, collect treasure, place bombs, throw ropes, pickup/throw chests, and use a whip. (3.1.3)

\subsection{Bomb}
The PoC tests covered creating, counting down, and exploding bombs. Bombs are created with a timer. The timer ticks down every second. Reaching 0 creates a explosion that damages everything nearby. (3.1.4)

\subsection{Rope}
The PoC tests covered creating, and extending ropes. Ropes can be thrown up and attach to a block or the background upon travelling the maximum distance. They can also be placed in front without throwing. (3.1.5)

\subsection{Weapon}
The PoC tests covered using the whip. It damages any enemies it touches while present, (3.1.6)

\subsection{Snake}
The PoC tests covered a player-snake interaction. This involved the player attack and snake attack. The player is able to defend themselves using a whip which can damage the health of a spider or stomp on a snake to completely kill it. Furthermore, if the player does not defend themselves then they can get health damage if the snake moves over them. (3.1.11)

\subsection{Collect treasure}
The PoC tests covered a the concept of a chest and collecting treasure coming from it. If the player comes in contact with treasure they can whose to open it. This results in a gold treasure that was in the box being placed where the treasure was originally. Next the player can choose whether or not they wish to collect the treasure. If they do then it increases their gold score. (3.1.7)

\subsection{Arrow Trap}
The PoC tests covered the arrow trap generation and the collision of the player with the shot arrow. It tested the arrow trap sensor to validate the behaviour of the trap follows the requirements. The PoC tests showed arrow trap was generated properly with a working sensor and ability to shoot arrows upon the player stepping into the attack area of the trap. (3.1.13)

\subsection{Spike Trap}
The PoC tests covered the spike trap generation and the ability to damage player upon a player stepping on a trap. The PoC showed that the system passes all the spike trap tests and it functions fully according to the functional requirements. (3.1.14)

\subsection{Level}
The PoC tests covered level generation. Levels were created from a map file. The location and types of all entities are specified and the layout of blocks in the level.(3.1.16)

\subsection{Sign}
The PoC tests covered displaying signs. Sign messages were shown at the bottom of the screen when the player was near one, (3.1.17)
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

The existing functionalities only involve:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Player movement: The player can jump and move right and left using keyboard inputs. Damage is taken for falling too far. 3.1.3}
\item{Map entities: Entities such as treasure, signs, map solid blocks and block spaces are created as part of the game map as soon as the game is started. 3.1.9}
\item{Chests: Chests can be interacted with and creates gold bars or rubies that are collected automatically. 3.1.9}
\item{Display: The camera is focused on the player. Health and gold are displayed. 3.1.2}
\item{Sign: Sign messages are displayed at the bottom of the screen when the player is near them. 3.1.17}
\end{enumerate}
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}

Unit Testing will be executed manually by running the game and following the test cases provided in section 3. Unit testing will be performed bottom-up. The individual parts of modules will be tested first and then the parts that require other modules. Since the modules are complete, there is no need for stubs or drivers.
Unit testing coverage metrics include achieving $90\%$ statement code coverage that will be done through the use of the code coverage tool Coverage.py. Not only that but also the team will manually ensure that the unit test cases will cover all the modules of the system and their methods. 
Coverage...
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

Internal functions will be tested using the tests specified in section 3. For every module, its functions are exercised in at least one of functional tests. The goal of each test is to verify and validate that the internal system functions meet the functional requirements of the system. These tests will be from the developer perspective that are executed by the developer inputs and manually. Therefore, the developer will have the choice to create more tests as seen fit.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}

The score save file should have \st{2 columns separated by commas. The first column are names up to nameLength characters and the second is the corresponding scores} \textcolor{red}{one entry of the highest score the user has attempted in the life time of the game being used}.
