\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of the project is developing a creative, interactive, and fully functional game version of Spelunky game using the Python2 open source version. The game is to be redeveloped in an innovative and more accessible way to be more appealing to the gaming community and to be easily accessed for any user who has access to the executable game. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

The stakeholders of the project include the gaming community which are the users of the product making them the primary stakeholders of the development course of the system. Also, the stakeholder includes all the interested parties of the system which are the clients, customers, and other associated parties interested in being secondary stakeholders. 

\subsubsection{The Client} 

The main clients of the project are the course instructor and the TAs as they are setting deadlines for project milestones and provide a view of customer feedback for project submissions. They are considered a primary stakeholder's because their requests and suggestions have the highest priority in the project development. In future advancements of the project, clients could include distribution platforms of the game. 

\subsubsection{The Customers}

The main customers of the product are the users. The users of the game will be desktop gamers of age 11 and above and demographic background who is interested in playing the game and has access to a PC. Another important customer base is interested developer parties such as the original game developers or the coding community interested in a learning opportunity and wants to see the project's merits and provide an outside opinion. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

The secondary stakeholders who do not directly influence the project development are third parties interested in incorporating the project with their business goals. This could include advertising parties, open source platform users, industry experts, and McMaster University. Advertisers may request to show case business related artifacts to raise awareness for their brand while supporting the project's development. On the other hand, open source platforms are interested in showcasing the project to increase their project database choices. 
Industry experts could include anywhere from game companies interested in containing the game with their systems to game testers and technology experts. Also, McMaster University could be a secondary stakeholder as the project is being developed by a team of engineering students and they do represent the engineering faculty with the work the development team produces. 

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The project is constrained by the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project must be fully developed and completed by the preset deadline of April 12, 2021.
    \item Project must be developed incrementally and meets all the intermediate deliverables' deadlines as stated and outlined by the course instructor. 
    \item The project must redevelop an open source product and provide licensing of usage. 
    \item The runtime and quality of the game will be constrained by the user's computer software and monitor.
    \item The project is to be developed with 0\$ budget and using only free software resources.
    \item The product will be tested to be compatible with Windows OS. 
    \item The product must adhere to University and course instructor's guidelines. 
    \item Due to limited time and resources, the project will prioritize meeting project requirements over graphic design. 
    \item The graphics functionality of the game will be limited by Pygame library resources. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

The sections will provide this document's terminology definitions and a list of the project's naming conventions and vocabulary. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item OS: Operating system. 
    \item Python: An OOP language used in the project development. The older version is Python2 and the most recent version Python3.
    \item Pygame: Computer graphics Python library. The most common game development Python library.
    \item Pylunky: The open source original Python Spelunky game being used for the project. 
    \item Spelunky: The original fully functional released game that provides a reference point for the new game objective. 
    \item MacLunky: The new redevelopment game in Python3 for this project. 
    \item Interface: The main game graphics and user application created by Pygame library. 
    \item User: The player who will be directly interacting with the game. This is one of the project's primary stakeholders. 
    \item Help Display: The game's help functionality includes instructions on how to interact with the game.
    \item Map: A file containing the entire layout of a level including blocks, enemies, traps, chests, signs, and doors.
    \item Level: A 2D area the user explores.
    \item Camera: The view of a level.
    \item Heart: Represents the user's health points in the game. 
    \item Screen: The game window interface where the game map and features are displayed. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

The relevant project facts include information on the original project code, design and technology. This includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The original game open source Pylunky is implemented using Python2 and deployed using Pygame. 
    \item The original game graphics and features is limited by the available resources of Pygame to create the game from the Python files. 
    \item The original project implementations had 646 lines of code.
    \item The original game was released as a zip file to be played by running a main game python file.
\end{itemize}
The project assumptions are related to defining user characteristics and how the game is expected to interact with the environment. Assumptions will include any decisions that directly affect the project development. The assumptions include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project will be able to use the original game open source files to build on and reshape the new game's features. 
    \item The project will be able to meet all the game's graphic requirements using Pygame library.
    \item The project will aim to recreate a different instance of the game to increase the game's excitement level. 
    \item The project assumes that the user has access to Pygame and Python to run the game files. 
    \item The project assumes the user knows how to run and play a desktop game using zip file released format. 
    \item The project assumes the user will be able to follow the game's instructions and understand the different symbols on the game screen. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product} %Abeer

The project will undertake the redevelopment of the Spelunky Python game version to add advanced new game features and implement a creative approach of how the player will interact with the system. The scope of the project will include a new Python3 implementation of the game with a running executable file as a user's interface and to introduce detailed documentation of the system's software and design. The new product will be released under the name "MacLunky". MacLunky is a single-player game that takes place in a 2D maze mapping with entry and exit points. The game's objective is to reach the exit door by following a specific winning path in the maze and completing the challenges presented along the way. The goal of the project is to introduce new customized game maps and incorporate interactive challenges and objects along the path of the game. The final product should be an executable game with functional interactive game features. The new project additions will include customized game maps that introduce new challenges the player must overcome to meet the game's objective. The player will be able to explore the map by moving forward, backward, up, and down the paths of the map. Not only that the player will be able to interact with objects placed on the map by collecting treasures that reward the player with bonuses, by avoiding path obstacles, and by fighting enemies to progress in the game. The new product will produce a working interactive game functionality with new creative map exploration that gives the user a new engaging experience of, the redeveloped game, MacLunky. 

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work} 

The original Pylunky has poor implementation documentation and not a fully functional game platform for the user to interact with to win the game. The original open source game files act as Spelunky Python version "tech demo" to illustrate a snapshot of the game design outline and starting point. Not only does Pylunky fail to deliver a user friendly game but it also fails to meet the software engineering design principle and process. Pylunky is not ideal for a developer to understand the game's file structure and working software as it lacks documentation and modular design in the project. Therefore, MacLunky has two goals: one, to redesign the game following software engineering principles and process for the benefit of other developers, and two, to give the user an interactive and engaging game with an understandable winning criteria and functionality.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
By using Pygame standards we limit the game's performance, speed and resolution because the game is built solely on this platform. Furthermore, we can not predict future system compatibility in the case of OS updates. The game keeps track of a scoring system. If we incorporated a leaderboard system, we can not predict that the current gaming software platforms will be compatible with a constantly updated player leaderboard system.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

The source code of the original Spelunky is available. However, because it is written using GameMaker Studio, it is not as easy to understand as Python. Also, GameMaker Studio requires a license and the source code is written for an older version.

\subsection{New Problems}
N/A

\subsection{Tasks}
The main source for task definition and completion is defined in the course outline and Gantt chart. The Gantt chart incorporates the due dates and milestones as per the course outline and also has a detailed subset of tasks outlined for each milestone completion. Apart from this the Gantt chart also has a resources tab that maintains the specific tasks assigned to each group member. In addition to this, the Gantt chart also provides a visually appealing planner that lists out what tasks are due for that day in the calendar.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A
\subsection{Risks}

The game is offline so there is no risk of unmonitored network access. The game collects no user data nor does it access files outside the game. There is no danger of physical harm to the user. Depending on the optimization, the game may cause the CPU to slowdown or overheat.

\subsection{Costs}

The project development and design should have no monetary costs as the team will be using open source libraries and tools. The development team will dedicate at least 2 hours of outside lab time for team meetings and 2 hours of individual work on the project weekly.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

The system will provide 3 means of user documentations and instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Instructions for the game will be presented to the user at the start of the game and the user will be able to access a HELP menu at any point in the game to understand the different game features and functionality.
    \item Installation document will be provided for the user to explain the procedure on how to download and prepare the user's OS environment to be able to play the game. 
    \item User manual will provide instructions and guidelines for how the game can be started using the released game version of the project and the basic functionality and rules of the game. The document will include an outline of the game features such as objects, the character, and enemies. Also, the document will contain a tutorial of the expected user-system interactions of starting the game and making a simple action in the game. This documentation will serve as the user training because the game is intuitive and has no learning curve to play the game.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Waiting Room} 

In future project release, the game could take on further development on the graphics of the game to increase the game quality and user experience. The game could include sound effects to increase the user engagement with the game. Also, the system could increase it's users base by developing an app version of the game to make it accessible to non-desktop gamers. 

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

During the requirement planning stage, a few suggestions were made on implementation solutions. One possible solution is to use a one game screen to be the user interface that includes the game settings and the only user-system interaction point. Another, idea that was proposed is to use the exit point of the game as the winning criteria of the game. Hence, if the user completes the game's objective then the game shuts down and the system exits the application window.
